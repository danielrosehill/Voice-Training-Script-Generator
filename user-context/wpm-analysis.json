      "transcript": "So, the purpose of this voice sample is to record approximately 60 seconds of my speech at a sort of natural pace.\nI mean, there are definitely times of the day, when I'm going to be speaking at a faster pace.\nUh, maybe after one has coffee, there is a noticeable increase in their words per minute or WPM.\nAnd likewise, if you were to record yourself at the end of the day before bed, I suspect that you would notice a decrease in your WPM.\nBut for the purpose of this audio sample, I'm going to try sort of speak roughly in the middle.\nThis is probably, it may be a little bit quicker.\nI think that when I, uh, start speaking into a microphone, for some reason, maybe this is just the way humans are, I naturally start speaking a little bit quicker.\nUh, possibly because I use this kind of technology all the time for speech to text, and therefore I sort of with trial and error have found that you can kind of push the boundaries of, um, how quickly you speak, maybe by, let's say 20% faster than you might naturally speak in order to, um, speed up the process a little bit.\nUh, but, uh, this is, so it's probably a little bit quicker, but I'm just trying to, um, speak a little bit more in order to get a more average sample, um, that is going to weigh out those, uh, little examples of speaking quickly that I tried to give at the start and maybe was misguided.\nSo, in fact, what I'm actually going to do to get a good WPM calculation is I'm going to actually extend this to a three minute audio sample.\nAnd for the remainder of those three minutes, you're going to hear some fascinating information about what I'm looking at on my desk.\nSo, I do have this wonderful USB button.\nIt is a, um, hardware button for voice dictation.\nIt cost all of $5 on AliExpress, and it's truly one of the best, uh, things I've ever bought.\nToday was Black Friday, and I thought to myself, on the one hand, I've gone to great length, uh, recently over the past year to declutter with the arrival of our, uh, dear new son.\nAnd, uh, so I'm being much, much more selective in what I purchase from the internet, partly also from a sustainability standpoint.\nI really dislike buying cheap tech that you just throw in the bin.\nUh, so I'm trying I'm actually really enjoying using AI tools in this respect.\nSometimes what I'll do is if I'm looking for something that is, you know, a bit more high value, let's say a mechanical keyboard, uh, which I really want to get a good one at some point.\nSo, I'll record a detailed spec about exactly what I'm looking for, and I'll just turn that over to an AI tool and say, \"Okay, here are all the details, um, find me something suitable or drop a spec and then find some matches on different marketplaces.\"\nSo, we've got to the three minute mark and, uh, hopefully we can get a fairly accurate WPM calculation here."
