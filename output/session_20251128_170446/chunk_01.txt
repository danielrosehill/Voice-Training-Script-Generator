Imagine a world where vast ice sheets sculpt the landscape, and colossal creatures roam freely. This wasn't a scene from a fantasy novel, but rather, a period in Earth's history known as the Ice Age. These weren't singular events, but a cyclical series of glacial advances and retreats that have dramatically shaped our planet for millions of years.

The most recent Ice Age, the Pleistocene Epoch, began around 2.6 million years ago. During this time, ice sheets expanded and contracted multiple times, impacting everything from sea levels to animal migration patterns. Think of woolly mammoths lumbering across frozen plains, or early humans adapting to the harsh conditions of a glacial environment.

But what triggered these dramatic shifts in climate? The answers are complex, involving a combination of factors. Changes in Earth's orbit, variations in solar activity, and even volcanic eruptions all played a role in tipping the balance towards colder temperatures. These factors influenced the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth, setting the stage for glacial expansion. The ice itself further reflected sunlight, creating a feedback loop that amplified the cooling effect.
